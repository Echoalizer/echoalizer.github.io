## Describe your project

You are currently viewing your project's **README** file. **_README_** files are like cover pages or elevator pitches
for your project. They are written in plain text
or [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and usually include a paragraph
describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.

## Your first website

**GitHub Pages** is a free and easy way to create a website using the code that lives in your GitHub repositories. You
can use GitHub Pages to build a portfolio of your work, create a personal website, or share a fun project that you coded
with the world. GitHub Pages is automatically enabled in this repository, but when you create new repositories in the
future, the steps to launch a GitHub Pages website will be slightly different.
